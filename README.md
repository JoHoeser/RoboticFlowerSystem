3D printed enclosure for the robotic flower system published by E. Kuusela &amp; J. Lämsä [Ecol Evol. 2016 Apr; 6(8): 2594–2600.]

All parts should be printed in PETG, since it is FDA compliant. We used green 2.85mm HDglass filament from FormFutura for our prints and achieved mostly watertight parts. After printing, the nectar-pot and the electronic compartment need to be connected together. We used the friction welding technique with the same material as used for printing, in order to avoid any substances hazardous to bees that may be conatined in any glue. This technique was also used to seal eventual leaks in the nectar-container.
